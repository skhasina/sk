As I'm going to be a QA specialist, I have some practice in testing. 
My first application for testing is going to be Multitran. 
It's multi-language dictionary that contains a lot of useful articals. 
I've decided that it would be convinient to have it not only web-version, but the application. 
While its installing, Iэму suffered some problems. 
It gave me a push to make a test for it.
